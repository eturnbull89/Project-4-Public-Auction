===============How To Use Agent===============
The clients interface (Agent) has been configured to run on a linux machine. Specifically, system out statements
are color coded and if run on a Windows machine may seem buggy. So, please do not take into consideration the buggyness
on a Windows machine, as per the classes guidelines we write code to run or be graded on the machines in lab. Thanks!

java -cp agent.jar {Bank host name} {Auction Central Host Name} {Bank Port Number} {Auction Central Port Number} {UserName}

1. Ensure the Bank server and Auction Central server are properly setup.
2. When running the jar, ensure the first argument is the Bank server IP, the second argument is the Auction Central
IP, and the third is your name. If not properly entered, the Agent will properly close and need to be restarted.
3. If you setup the Bank and Auction Central correctly, you will now be at the Main Menu prompt of the Agent, where you
can either 1. see a list of auction houses, or $ see current account balance. Note that every agent starts out with an
account balance of 100.
4. If no Auction House server has been setup, the list of auction houses will be empty, so make sure to setup
some auction houses so you can start playing!
5. From here on out, the prompts through the command line will guide you on how to play. Just follow their direction!
