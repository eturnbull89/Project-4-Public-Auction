 * AuctionHouse is used to communicate with Agents and allow them to bid on items stored in the auction house. Each
 * AuctionHouse has a number of variables that are set from the command line. houseHost is a string that contains the
 * host name that his auction house will be located at. housePort is the port number for this auction house. houseName
 * is the visual name of an auction house, i.e. if the house is selling art it could be named Art. centralPort is the
 * port number that auction central is located at. centralHost is the hostname that auction central is located at. The
 * above variables are set via command line arguments. houseReg is used to hold the Confirmation that a house registered
 * with auction central. listIndex is used to indicate where the sales list should start. items stores the AuctionItems
 * this auction house will have for auction.

     * main is an AuctionHouses starting point. It first checks that the number of arguments given in the command line
     * is at least 6. If not it prints an error message and exits. If it is it then creates a new AuctionHouse object
     * and sets its variables to the parameters passed. The last argument is used to specify which items from the
     * salesList this auction house should show. If the value set is not between 1 and 3 it defaults to a value of 1 to
     * sell art items. It then creates a variable to hold the auction houses server socket and a boolean that will
     * indicates if the house was registered with auction central. It then tries to set the server socket variable to the
     * port number passed in args[1], create a socket with auction central using the given host name and port number,
     * and open input/output streams with auction central. It then enters a while loop that will run until the auction
     * house is closed. It checks if the house has been registered yet, if not it creates a new registration object
     * and sends it to auction central via the centralOut output stream. Once it receives a confirmation back it sets
     * the value of houseReg to the confirmation returned and then sets the value of registered to true to prevent
     * re-registration. It then starts to accept Agents start their bidding. When an Agent connects to an auction house
     * it creates a MiniHouse that runs on its own thread to service the agent and starts that thread.
