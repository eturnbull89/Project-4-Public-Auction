 * MiniHouse is used to allow an Agent to communicate with an AuctionHouse. MiniHouse extends Thread so that multiple
 * agents can be processed at once. Each MiniHouse has a number of variables that are set in its constructor.
 * agentSocket is used to communicate back and forth with an agent via a socket connection. centralIn and centralOut
 * are object input and output streams that allow communication with auction central. items is an array list of
 * AuctionItems that each auction house has available for auction. winnerList is an ArrayList that contains items
 * that have finished being bid on and contain the winners information. houseKey is a secretKey that is used for
 * updating an AuctionItems fields. MiniHouse has a defined run method that processes each agents request via different
 * objects. bidProtocol is used to process an Agents bid request. countdown is used to start the 30 second timer after
 * a successful bid has been placed and then process if the agent is the winner. itemExists is used to check if an
 * AuctionItem is still available for bidding. findIndex is used to find an AuctionItems current index value. winner is
 * used to check if an Agent won the bid on an AuctionItem. closeProtocol is used to shutdown an auction house early.

     * placed on an agents account. agentKey is used to hold the bidKey of the agent, passed in the bid. bidAmount is
     * used to hold the amount of money an agent wants to bid on an object. item is the AuctionItem an agent wants to
     * bid on. stillListed is used to check if the passed item is still available for auction. If an item is
     * stillListed then it sets up the next round of variables to continue processing an agents bid. itemIndex is used
     * to lookup current index of an AuctionItem in the items list. previousBidder is used to check if an agent is
     * the previous bidder or the first bidder, this is used to prevent an agent from placing multiple bids in before
     * a different bid has taken place. highestBid is used to check if the value an agent wants to bid is greater then
     * both the minimumBid amount and the current highestBid amount. If an agent is not the previousBidder and their
     * bid is the highestBid then a new hold AuctionTransaction is created using the agents bidKey and bidAmount. The
     * transaction is then written to auction central and the auction house waits for confirmation of the hold. If the
     * hold is successfully placed and the highestBid did not change in the time it took for a confirmation to occur
     * then the highestBidderKey and highestBid fields of an AuctionItem in both the items list and the item passed
     * are set with the Agents bidKey and bidAmount. If the previousBidderKey and previousBid fields are not null it
     * then sets these to the previous Agents bidKey and bidAmount and another AuctionTransaction is created to release
     * the previousBidders funds. Finally the bidStatus in the bid is set to Acceptance to indicate a successful bid
     * was placed. If the highestBid amount changed in the time it took to get confirmation of the hold another
     * AuctionTransaction is created to release the agents funds from the hold and written to AuctionCentral. Then the
     * highestBid amount in the item passed via the bid is updated to the current highestBid in the items list and the
     * bidStatus in the bid is set to reject to indicate the agents bid was overtaken. If for some reason the funds from
     * an Agents account could not be put on hold the bidStatus is set to Rejection to indicate such. If the agent was
     * the previousBidder then the bid status is updated to pass to prevent the agent from making another bid until
     * their bid is overtaken. If the Agent was not the previousBidder but their bid wasn't high enough right away the
     * bidStatus is set to reject to inform the agent to place a higher bid. If the item is not stillListed the bid
     * status is set to over to indicate the bidding on the item has finished. At the end of any case the updated bid
